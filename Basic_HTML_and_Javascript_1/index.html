							<p>This is my favorite anime to date: Code Geass, it's essentially
								<br>a what-if scenario where the British Empire never fell and
								<br>instead became a world superpower. The main character is
								<br>a prince of the empire who is exiled to Japan, which is
								<br>now called Area 11. He is given a power called Geass,
								<br>which allows him to command anyone to do anything he
								<br>wants. He uses this power to start a rebellion against
								<br>the empire and eventually take over the world.

							<p>This anime places #2 on my list: Kenichi - The Mightiest Disciple,
								<br>the story begins with the young, unremarkable Kenichi Shirahama
								<br>who is constantly bullied by his classmates and members of the
								<br>Koryou High School Karate Club. He is approached by a new student
								<br>named Miu Furinji, who turns out to be a powerful martial artist
								<br>and offers to train Kenichi in martial arts. Kenichi eventually
								<br>joins the Ryozanpaku dojo, a dojo that is home to some of the
								<br>most powerful martial artists in the world. Kenichi trains under
								<br>the masters of the dojo and eventually becomes a powerful martial
								<br>artist himself. Trained in various martial arts, possessing
								<br>a gentle and kind heart, Kenichi uses his training to protect
								<br>the weak and innocent from the many enemies he encounters.

							<p>This one ranks #3 on my list: The Misfit of Demon King Academy.
								<br>The story begins with the Demon King of Tyranny, Anos Voldigoad,
								<br>who during the war between humans and demons, sacrifices himself
								<br>to divide the different worlds with the ultimate barrier spell,
								<br>saving his people. 2000 years later, he is reincarnated as a
								<br>"hybrid" of a demon and a human, and attends the Demon King
								<br>Academy, where he is considered a misfit due to his immense
								<br>magical power and inhumanely low scores on the entrance exams.
								<br>He soon learns that the name of the Demon King of Tyranny is
								<br>Avos Dilhevia, and that no one believes he is the reincarnation
								<br>of the Demon King, despite his overwhelming power. He decides
								<br>to reclaim his former title and place as the Demon King,
								<br>and thus begins his journey.

							<p>Coming in at #4 is Assassination Classroom, this anime tells the
								<br>story of a class of misfits who are tasked with assassinating
								<br>their teacher, who is a powerful alien that has destroyed the
								<br>moon and threatens to destroy the earth in a year. The students
								<br>are given special weapons and abilities to help them in their
								<br>mission, but the teacher is a master of assassination himself,
								<br>and teaches the students how to be assassins while also teaching
								<br>them life lessons. The students eventually grow to love their
								<br>teacher and become attached to him, and the teacher also grows
								<br>to love his students. The students eventually learn that their
								<br>teacher is not the monster they thought he was, and that he
								<br>actually cares about them and wants them to succeed in life.

							<p>For #5, we have Kill la Kill. This masterpiece of an
								<br>anime tells the story of a world where clothing is
								<br>power, and the main character, Ryuko Matoi, is on a
								<br>mission to find her father's killer. She is given a
								<br>special uniform called a Kamui, which is a sentient
								<br>uniform that gives her immense power. She attends a
								<br>school called Honnouji Academy, which is ruled by the
								<br>student council president, Satsuki Kiryuin. Satsuki
								<br>rules the school with an iron fist, and Ryuko is
								<br>challenged by Satsuki to a duel. Ryuko eventually
								<br>learns that Satsuki knows the identity of her father's
								<br>killer. Ryuko and Satsuki eventually team up to take
								<br>down the true enemy, who is the CEO of a clothing
								<br>company called REVOCS, who is using clothing to
								<br>control the world.

							<p>At #6 we have the father of all anime: the Dragon Ball franchise!
								<br>Dragon Ball tells the story of Goku, a Saiyan (alien warrior race)
								<br>who was sent to earth as a baby to destroy it, but instead
								<br>became its greatest warrior and protector. He is joined by his
								<br>friends Bulma, Krillin, Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu, and together
								<br>they go on many adventures and fight many enemies. Dragon Ball Z
								<br>takes place 5 years after the end of Dragon Ball, and tells the
								<br>story of Goku's son, Gohan, and his friends as they fight to
								<br>protect the earth from the evil Saiyan, Vegeta, and his partner,
								<br>Nappa, after that traveling to Planet Namek and facing off against
								<br>the emperor of the universe: Frieza. Following Frieza come the androids
								<br>and Cell, a bio-mechanical android created for the sole purpose of
								<br>destroying Goku, who his son Gohan defeats. Dragon Ball Z ends with
								<br>Goku and his friends facing off against the evil Majin Buu in a battle
								<br>to determine the fate of the entire universe. Dragon Ball Super takes
								<br>place 6 months after the end of Dragon Ball Z, and tells the story of
								<br>Goku and his friends as they face off against the God of Destruction,
								<br>Beerus, and later other universes' finest warrior in the Tournament of Power.
								<br>Dragon Ball GT takes place 10 years after the end of Dragon Ball Z, and
								<br>tells the story of Goku and his friends as they travel the universe in
								<br>search of the Black Star Dragon Balls, which are scattered across
								<br>the universe. After that, they face off against the evil Baby, who
								<br>has taken over the earth and turned everyone into his slaves. After
								<br>that, they face off against the evil Shadow Dragons, who are the
								<br>result of the overuse of the Dragon Balls, which Goku and friends defeat
								<br>by calling forth the miraculous Spirit Bomb technique.

							<p>This is my favorite anime to date: Code Geass, it's essentially
								<br>a what-if scenario where the British Empire never fell and
								<br>instead became a world superpower. The main character is
								<br>a prince of the empire who is exiled to Japan, which is
								<br>now called Area 11. He is given a power called Geass,
								<br>which allows him to command anyone to do anything he
								<br>wants. He uses this power to start a rebellion against
								<br>the empire and eventually take over the world.
